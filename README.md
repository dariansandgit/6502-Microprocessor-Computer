# 6502-Microprocessor-Computer
Several ground-breaking computer systems, including the Apple II, Atari 800, and Nintendo Entertainment System, were built on the 6502 Microprocessor, an antiquated but innovative piece of hardware. While studying CPUs, I came across the 6502 microprocessor, which piqued my interest as a electricalÂ engineering student. I was eager to acquire one so that I could test and broaden my understanding of computer design and development by using it to construct a fully functional computer. This project's objective was to put the hardware together and build an Assembly program that would print the words "Hello, World!" onto an LCD display. The allure of computers, particularly those with the 6502, is the limitless things you can do with them.
